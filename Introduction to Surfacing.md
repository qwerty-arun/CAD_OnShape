# Key Learnings
- Solid modelling v/s surface modelling
- Creating split lines for molds, bridging geometries together
- A surface is built face-by-face
- Curvature Visualisation if a very powerful tool
- Hybrid modellingg
- Basic features: extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, offset surface, thicken, enclose, boolean, delete face.
- Revise Curves for a refresher
- Struggled with extruding a surface to another one.
